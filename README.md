### Project Name: Task Tracker

#### **Description**  
This project is a simple yet functional **Task Tracker application** built using **React.js**. It allows users to efficiently manage their tasks by adding, deleting, and marking tasks as complete. The project is modular, with reusable components for better scalability and maintainability.

---

#### **Features**
1. **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks with a description and a due date.  
2. **Delete Tasks**: Tasks can be removed individually when no longer needed.  
3. **Mark as Complete**: Users can mark tasks as complete or incomplete, with a visual indicator (strikethrough text).  
4. **Dynamic State Management**: Uses `useState` to dynamically update the list of tasks without refreshing the page.  

---

#### **Key Components**
1. **App Component (`Apptoto.js`)**:
   - The main component that manages the state (`tasks`) and renders other components.
   - **State**:
     - `tasks`: An array of task objects, each containing `id`, `task`, `date`, and `completed`.
   - **Functions**:
     - `addTask`: Adds a new task to the `tasks` array.
     - `deleteTask`: Removes a task from the list based on its `id`.
     - `toggleComplete`: Toggles the completion status of a task.

2. **TaskForm Component (`Taskform.js`)**:
   - A form component where users can input task details (description and date).
   - **Features**:
     - Input fields for task description and due date.
     - Submit button to add tasks.
   - **State**:
     - `task`: Stores the task description entered by the user.
     - `date`: Stores the due date entered by the user.

3. **TaskItem Component (`Taskitem.js`)**:
   - Represents an individual task in the task list.
   - **Features**:
     - Checkbox to toggle task completion.
     - Displays task description and due date.
     - Delete button to remove the task.

4. **TaskList Component (`Tasklist.js`)**:
   - Renders a list of `TaskItem` components.
   - Iterates through the `tasks` array and passes the necessary props (`task`, `deleteTask`, `toggleComplete`) to `TaskItem`.

#### **Styling**
- Custom CSS files (`Apptoto.css` and `Index.css`) are included to enhance the visual appearance of the app.

---

#### **How to Run**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to launch the application in the browser.

---

#### **Future Improvements**
1. Implement local storage or a database to persist tasks across sessions.
2. Add priority levels for tasks.
3. Enhance UI/UX with better styling and animations.
4. Add a filter/search feature to organize tasks based on status or date.
